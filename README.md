🚀 **Integration Developer | Python | Middleware Specialist | AI Intern**



## 💼 About Me  
I’m an Integration Developer with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and managing enterprise integrations using **IBM ACE**, **IBM MQ**, **IBM API Connect (APIC)**, **Apigee**, and **DataPower**.  
Currently, I’m expanding my skills into **AI engineering** — building small AI-based applications using **Python** and **OpenAI API**.


## 🔧 Technical Expertise  
### 🧩 Integration & Middleware  
- **IBM ACE (App Connect Enterprise):** Designed, deployed, and optimized message flows across multiple back-end systems.  
- **IBM MQ:** Configured queues, managed channels, and monitored message delivery for reliability and performance.  
- **IBM API Connect (APIC):** Built secure, scalable API proxies with OAuth 2.0, rate-limiting, and fault handling.  
- **IBM DataPower:** Implemented gateway policies, XML/JSON transformation, and security enforcement.  
- **Apigee Edge / X:** Integrated APIs with GCP services (Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions), and configured quota, caching, and traffic throttling policies.

### 🧠 AI & Automation  
- Building an **AI Ad Copy Generator** using **Python + OpenAI API**  
- Exploring **Generative AI**, **Prompt Engineering**, and **Automation Scripts**  
- Interested in combining **AI with Integration** to create intelligent, event-driven systems  

### 💻 Programming & Tools  
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, XML, JSON  
- **Tools:** Postman, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Apigee Trace  
- **Cloud:** AWS (VPC, EC2, S3, Glue), GCP (Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions)
